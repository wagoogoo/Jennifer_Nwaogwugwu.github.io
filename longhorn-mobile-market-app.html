    <h2><strong>1. Problem</strong></h2>
        <p>Currently, a Facebook group page called “UT buy/sell/trade” exists. University of Texas at Austin students and alumni use this page to buy, sell, trade, and give away various items such as clothing, furniture, and even cars. However, users, namely our fellow students, voiced concerns about the limitations of searching for specific items and specific sales.</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;">
    <h2><strong>2. Solution</strong></h2>
        <p>We created The Longhorn Mobile Market to  enhance the peer-to-peer (P2P) buying, selling, and trading experience for students at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>

    <h2><strong>3. User Research and Interviews</strong></h2>
        <h4>3.1 Interviews and Surveys</h4>
        <!--        <p>Our questions were designed for students who interact with the page through browsing, posting to sell or buy, or using any other function of the page. We also asked questions about previous experiences to discover motivations and usage patterns. Facebook is accessible on mobile and desktop, but we chose to focus on mobile use of the page as our envisioned system will be a mobile app.</p>
        <p>We also wanted to see the students use the Facebook page. During our interviews, we included a set of observation questions to obtain task data. These questions focused on how participants generally used the page, how they looked for something specific on the page, and how they post on the page.</p>-->
        <p>Since the UT Buy page is exclusive to UT students, we set out to find students on campus. Our interview pool consisted of UT undergrad students, graduate students, and recent UT grads. <strong>Seven individuals</strong> were interviewed, and we surveyed <strong>26 people</strong>, 5 of whom were not aware of the system.<p/>

        </div>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>We saw some reoccuring themes and statements by the interviewees. Many of the interviewees expressed that they liked the email verification feature of the Facebook page in terms of security. They also commented on the limitations of Facebook's search filters.</p>
        
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Interviewee 3 Quote</h4>
                <p>"I like that it's a safe place to sell, unlike Craigslist where you don't know who you're selling to or if they have other motives."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Interviewee 4 Quote</h4>
                <p>"The page should have separate tabs for buying, selling, and lost and found instead of having it all mixed up in one page. The search function should be more noticeable. I like the sub-categories that Craigslist has."</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Through our research, we determined that the predominate users use the system via:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Selling or Trading Posts, which sellers create and buyers interact with;</li>
                <li>Buyer’s Request Posts, which buyers post to alert users who are interested in a specific item; and</li>
                <li>Lost Posts and Found Posts, which owners and finders create.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>We represented this in a usage flow model.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">

        <h4>3.2 Results Analysis and WAAD</h4>
<!--        <p>Once we completed the interviews and obtained the responses to our survey, we gathered our data and visualized it with a Workflow Activity Affinity Diagram (WAAD). With the WAAD we categorized our question and survey responses.</p>
        <p>First, we formed categories based on the questions we asked in our user interviews. Afterward, we examined the interview responses in conjunction with our survey responses to make sure the survey data was represented by a WAAD note.</p>-->
        <p>Some reoccuring themes that we noted as we created the WAAD included issues with <strong>post motivation, trust, page interaction, and page usability</strong>.</p>

        <h2><strong>4. Ideation</strong></h2>
        <h4>4.1 Feature Prioritization</h4>
        <p>The results from our research suggested that UT students would benefit from a <strong>mobile app that addresses the issue of product organization and prioritizes user security</strong>.</p>
        <p>We decided that the main organization function would be to catalogue items by different categories in terms of item type. <!--The app would feature stronger filter functions like tag search and cost range. Moreover, users were concerned about safety and security. -->The app would feature a verification process that made it exclusive only to UT affiliated individuals and a meetup feature to record the intended site for their transaction.</p>
        
        <h4>4.2 Persona and Usage Scenarios</h4>
        <p>We started by creating a persona of a typical student that would use the page. Research showed that a typical student would be a female upperclassman that lives off-campus. Many students  often look for inexpensive and expendable furniture from other students who inevitably graduate and move out of Austin.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">
            <div class="col-md-12">

            </div>
        </div>
      
        <br>
        
        <p>We determined that three usage scenarios would best demonstrate the three main actions of the app. These scenarios were: a user interested in buying, a user interested in selling, and a user finds a misplaced item (lost and found).</p>
      </div>
      
    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;">
        <h2>5. Design</h2>
        <h4>5.1 Interaction Design and Storyboarding</h4>
        <p>We sketched different task flows and determined the potential screens to create to follow the flow. I created a storyboard that visualized a student completing the task of posting an item on the app.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">
             <div class="col-md-12">

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h4>5.2 Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
        <p>Sketching the wireframes allowed us to smoothly transition from paper to digital. We used Balsamiq to create our low-fidelity mockups.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">
             <div class="col-md-12" style="margin-top: 30px">

                <p>Low-fidelity mockups using Balsamiq</p>
            </div>
        </div>
          
        <h4>5.3 Usability Testing</h4>
        <p>We had two phases of prototyping and testing. During the pilot testing of our initial prototype, users provided feedback to apply to our app. We used that feedback to make changes to the features.</p>
        <p>Some issues found were confusion about the verification process, difficulty finding the meetup feature, and lack of clarity of the icons. After meeting and discussing the issues, we made revisions on the low-fis. This allowed for a faster creation of the high-fidelity mockups. Invision was used for prototyping and Sketch for creating the high-fis.</p>
        
        <h4>5.4 High-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">

        <h2><strong>Moving Forward</strong></h2>
            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
            <p>If this app were to be developed, one iteration I would attempt is on the product detail page. If another item with an identical or similar title, description, and price were to be listed, the user can become confused and select the wrong item from the wrong person. A thumbnail image of the item on the product item screen can address that issue. The thumbnail can be similar to the image used in the message screen.</p>
            <p>By designing Longhorn Mobile Market my group and I were able to experience the complexities of moving a system from one platform (the Facebook app) to another (a full-fledged mobile app). It was a challenging experience, but I learned a lot along the way.</p>
