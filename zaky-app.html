    <h2><strong>The Need</strong></h2>
        <h4>Preemies at Risk</h4>
        <p>Of the 131.4 million births around the world, about <strong>20 million infants</strong> fall into the category of “LBW,” or low-birth-weight. Typically born in less-developed countries, these preterm, or preemie, infants have a <strong>higher chance of neonatal mortality</strong> because of their delayed development. In 2016, <strong>2.6 million neonatal deaths</strong> occurred within the first month of life, of which <strong>preemie and LBW babies represent more than a fifth</strong>.</p>
        <h4>A Solution</h4>
        <p>Nurtured By Design provided a solution with the Zaky Zak. The Zaky Zak encourages kangaroo care. Kangaroo care (KC) is prolonged skin-to-skin contact between the mother and child.</p>
        <p>Studies show that preemies whose parents kangaroo them have better <strong>thermal control</strong>, <strong>higher chances to breastfeed</strong>, and <strong>better bonding between the parent and the infant</strong>. This increases the chances for survival for the infant. Nurtured By Design aimed to encourage more parents to KC with the Zaky Zak with the creation of a mobile app, the Zaky App, that tracks infants’ biometrics via bluetooth.</p>
        <p>Nurtured By Design approached my Rapid Prototyping class to create a functioning prototype.</p>

    <h2><strong>Getting Started</strong></h2>
        <h4>Stakehold Interview</h4>
        <p>Nutured By Design's CEO Yamile Jackson visited our class. She shared with us her personal story and provided insight about preemie risks. She also gave told us her vision for the Zaky App.</p>
        <h4>Initial Research</h4>
        <p>Nutured By Design did extensive research the area of preemies. I decided to dive in with an informal competitive analysis of other biotracking and habit tracking apps. Apps like Fitbit, Owlet, and BabyBee were helpful in providing initial conceptions of how the app should function.</p>
        <p>We also wanted to see the students use the Facebook page. During our interviews, we included a set of observation questions to obtain task data. These questions focused on how participants generally used the page, how they looked for something specific on the page, and how they post on the page.</p>

                <p>"I like that it's a safe place to sell, unlike Craigslist where you don't know who you're selling to or if they have other motives."</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Interviewee 4 Quote</h4>
                <p>"The page should have separate tabs for buying, selling, and lost and found instead of having it all mixed up in one page. The search function should be more noticeable. I like the sub-categories that Craigslist has."</p>

        <p>Through our research, we determined that the predominate users use the system via:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Selling or Trading Posts, which sellers create and buyers interact with;</li>
                <li>Buyer’s Request Posts, which buyers post to alert users who are interested in a specific item; and</li>
                <li>Lost Posts and Found Posts, which owners and finders create.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>We represented this in a usage flow model.</p>

        <h4>Results Analysis</h4>
        <p>Once we completed the interviews and obtained the responses to our survey, we gathered our data and visualized it with a work activity affinity diagram (WAAD). With WAAD we categorized our question and survey responses.</p>
        <p>We initially formed categories based on the questions we asked in our user interviews. Afterward, we examined the interview responses in conjunction with our survey responses to make sure the survey data was represented by a WAAD note.</p>
        <p>Some reoccuring themes that we noted as we created the WAAD included issues with <strong>post motivation, trust, page interaction, and page usability</strong>.</p>

        <h2><strong>Ideation</strong></h2>
        <h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
        <p>Based on the WAAD, we were able to hone in on issues we could address in the amount of time we had. The results from our research suggested that UT students would benefit from a <strong>mobile app that addresses the issues of product organization and user security</strong>.</p>
        <p>After looking at other marketing apps, we decided that the main organization function would be to catalogue items by different categories in terms of item type. The app would feature stronger filter functions like tag search and cost range. Moreover, users were concerned about safety and security. The app would feature a verification process that made it exclusive only to UT affiliated individuals and a meetup feature that users could utilize to record on the system the intended site for their transaction.</p>
        <h4>Persona and Usage Scenarios</h4>
        <p>We started by creating a persona of a typical student that would use the page. Research showed that a typical student would be a female upperclassman that lives off-campus. Many students are often looking for inexpensive and expendable furniture from other students who inevitably graduate and out of Austin.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <div class="col-md-12 probootstrap-animate">

            </div>
        </div>
      
        <br>
        <p>We determined that three usage scenarios would best demonstrate the three main actions of the app. These scenarios were: a user interested in buying, a user interested in selling, and a user finds a misplaced item (lost and found).</p>
        <h4>Interaction Design and Storyboarding</h4>
        <p>We sketched different task flows and determined the potential screens to create to follow the flow. I created a storyboard that visualized a student completing the task of posting an item on the app.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;">

            </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Wireframes</h4>
        <p>Sketching the wireframes allowed us to smoothly transition from paper to digital. We used Balsamiq to create our low-fidelity mockups.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;">

    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;">  
        <h2><strong>Prototype Iterations</strong></h2>
            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
            <p>We had two phases of prototyping and testing. During the pilot testing of our initial prototype, users provided feedback to apply to our app, and we used that feedback to make changes to the features.</p>
            <p>Some issues found were confusion about the verification process, difficulty finding the meetup feature, and lack of clarity of the icons. After meeting and discussing the issues, we made revisions on the low-fis. This allowed for a faster creation of the high-fidelity mockups. Invision was used for the prototyping and Sketch for the high-fis.</p>

        <h2><strong>Moving Forward</strong></h2>
            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
            <p>Through Longhorn Mobile Market, my group and I were able to experience the complexities of moving a system from one platform (the Facebook app) to another (a full-fledged mobile app). It was a challenging experience, but I learned a lot along the way. One iteraction to the app I would attempt is on the product detail page. If another item with an identical or similar title, description, and price were to be listed, the user could potentially get confused and select the wrong item from the wrong person. A thumbnail image of the item on the product item screen can address that issue. The thumbnail can be similar to the image used in the message screen.</p>
