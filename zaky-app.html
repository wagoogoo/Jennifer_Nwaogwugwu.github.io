    <h2><strong>The Need</strong></h2>
        <h4>Preemies at Risk</h4>
        <p>Of the 131.4 million births around the world, about <strong>20 million infants</strong> fall into the category of “LBW,” or low-birth-weight. Typically born in less-developed countries, these preterm, or preemie, infants have a <strong>higher chance of neonatal mortality</strong> because of their delayed development. In 2016, <strong>2.6 million neonatal deaths</strong> occurred within the first month of life, of which <strong>preemie and LBW babies represented more than a fifth</strong>.</p>
        <h4>A Solution</h4>
        <p>Nurtured By Design provided a solution with the Zaky Zak. The Zaky Zak assists with kangaroo care. Kangaroo care (KC) is prolonged skin-to-skin contact between the mother and child.</p>
        <p>Studies show that preemies whose parents kangaroo them have <strong>better thermal control</strong>, <strong>higher chances to breastfeed</strong>, and <strong>better bonding between the parent and the infant</strong>. This increases the chances for survival for the infant. Nurtured By Design aimed to encourage more parents to KC with the Zaky Zak by placing a bluetooth biometric sensor in the Zaky Zak. They wanted a mobile app, the Zaky App, to track the vitals captured by the sensor.</p>
        <p>Nurtured By Design approached my Rapid Prototyping class to create a functioning app mockup prototype.</p>

    <h2><strong>Getting Started</strong></h2>
        <h4>Stakeholder Interview</h4>
        <p>Nutured By Design's CEO Yamile Jackson visited our class. She shared with us her personal story and provided insight about preemie risks. She also told us her vision for the Zaky App. The goal for this app is to <strong>encourage kangaroo care</strong>.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Initial Research</h4>
        <p>Our class adopted the Google Sprint method for this project. Nutured By Design did extensive research in the area of preemies and new mothers. I decided to dive in with an informal competitive analysis of other biotracking and habit tracking apps. Apps like Fitbit, Owlet, and BabyBee were helpful in creating initial concepts of the app.</p>
        
        <p>I found that majority of the apps were clean, had helpful articles, and a logging feature that allowed for notes. However, some didn't have a community feature or incentives and used medical terminmology that might be unfamilar to mothers. There was ample opportunity to make a helpful app for new moms.</p>

        <h2><strong>Interaction Design</strong></h2>
        
        <h4>Storyboarding</h4>
        <p>We started our design phase by creating storyboards. I made two three-panel storyboards of a mom prepping for KC and another of a mom completing a log for feeding. This storyboard helped me see the context of the use of the app as well as visualize the potential screens needed for the app.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Scenario Mapping</h4>
        <p>Our class decided that creating scenarios, rather than creating personas, would provide a better representation parents' interact with the app. In small groups we created three different scenarios that incorporated the stakeholder’s desired features of the app.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">
            <div class="col-md-12">

                <p>I recreated the three scenarios on Sketch</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Pivoting</h4>
        
        <p>Due to the timeline and the fact that I was working by myself, I needed to tailor the scope of the project. I decided to cater the app to infants 0 to 3 months since finding preemie mothers would be difficult given the time and resources I had. Features I prioritized were a KC timer, daily logs, analytics, and notifications and alerts.</p>
        
        <h4>Low-fi Mockups</h4>
        <p>The scenarios I broke into tasks, and I created my low-fi mockup screens based off of each interaction and the feature it showcased.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">

        <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        
        <div class="container">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>Once completed, I had the opportunity to test my prototype with two new mothers. After testing, both mothers completed the Single Ease Question (SEQ) Survey, and the mockup received a rating of 6 out of 7, with 7 being very easy to use. The feedback they provided was very helpful for the next interation for the high-fi prototype.</p>
                    <p>Notable Suggestions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The terminology used in the app needed to be updated.</li>
                            <li>A notes section included in each log would be helpful.</li>
                            <li>Clearer contrast between icons and system feedback when selecting items.</li>
                            <li>Name labels for the icons on the logging feature.</li>
                        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Project Reflections</strong></h2>
        
        <h4>Moving Foward</h4>
            <p>If this app were to be developed, I gave some additional suggestions to the stakeholder. The stakeholder advocated for easy exchange of the baby's data with other parents. Based on my interviews, I communicated to her that parents should have the choice to share with the community and with their doctor. Perhaps this can be a option that can be enabled in the Zaky App settings.</p>    
        
        <h4>Failures</h4>
             <ul>
                <li><b>I only had usability tests with two moms.</b> The Google Sprint method suggested that at most five to seven people are needed to find majority of issues in an app.</li>
                <li><b>Yamile didn't contact me for further information on my prototype.</b> That was a little discouraging. But I belive that the methods and interaction design knowledge I gained was priceless.</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h4>Wins</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>I incorporated the social feature in the high-fi mockup.</b> I didn't have the chance to elaborate deeply on the feature. However, it serves well as an initial concept.</li>
                <li><b>The SEQ Survey was a huge help in scaling usability during the usability testing.</b> It was my first time using the scale. It was pretty straightfoward, and I appreciated the immediate feedback from the users.</li>
            </ul>
