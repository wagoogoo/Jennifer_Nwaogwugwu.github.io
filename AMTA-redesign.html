    <h2><strong>The Need</strong></h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.musictherapy.org/">American Music Therapy Association (AMTA)</a> is committed to the advancement of education, training, professional standards, credentials, and research in support of the music therapy profession. Upon looking at the site, we determined that AMTA's website's user interface and information architecture could benefit from a redesign. We started with a heuristic evaluation to get an indepth look at AMTA's site.</p>

    <h2><strong>Evaluative Research</strong></h2>
        <h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
        <p>Looking at the American Musical Therapy Association’s goals for their website, we were able to create AMTA’s pool of their intended audience. We identified the audience of the site as music therapists, patients and the family of current patients or potential patients, and other individuals who care about music therapy or who may want to donate to the association. We did a heuristic evaluation with these intended audiences in mind. Based on our findings, we created an inital redesign of the site.</p>

        <h4>Content Inventory</h4>
        <p>The AMTA site offers a lot of information, but it is not well-organized. The content hierarchy of the site is three levels. The first level is the menu level (e.g. Home, Contact, and News). The rest of the levels are sub-content of the first level. Here, we found that within most of the first level pages are the links to their low-level pages, so the pages are redundant. Also, we found that there are many duplicate pages. Some pages require an AMTA member login, so we couldn’t get any information from those pages. The website page format consists of either .html or .pdf. For users, especially those who visit the website via mobile devices, these inconsistent formats are difficult to navigate. This is a portion of our content inventory.</p>

        <br>
        
        <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p>With this competitive analysis, we wanted to compare the AMTA website with others of its kind to know what features are necessary to keep, add, or delete. We selected our competitors, or peers, by looking at the therapy industry. Our focus was to organize the content of the AMTA website, so we prioritized looking at the information architecture. </p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">

        <br>
        
        <p>To sum it up:
            <ul>
                <li>AMTA scored high in ambiguous organization because a lot of the IA involved organizing by task.</li>
                <li>AMTA can improve the simplicity of language and consistency of terms on their site by changing the wording of their labels.</li>
                <li>AMTA performs the worst visually among all websites. The site is not responsive, the homepage is wordy, and the consistency of color throughout the site very low.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    


    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;">
        <h2><strong>Ideation</strong></h2>
        <h4>Personas</h4>
        <p>Because we could not connect with any music therapists and organizations due to limited time and resources, we did not interview any music therapists for the personas. Hence, we searched and read existing interviews of music therapists, gathered information from these interviews, and categorized them. We created two personas based on our research.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <div class="col-md-6">

                <p>This persona reflects music therapists who are middle-aged and are established in the field.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="img/MT/mt-persona2.png" alt="The second persona." class="img-responsive">

        <br>
        
        <h4>Card Sorting</h4>
        <p>To initiate the reorganization of AMTA, we conducted a card sorting anaylsis. To conduct the card sorting efficiently, we used online card sorting tool built by Optimal Workshop. We started with <strong>27 categories</strong>. There were <strong>13 participants</strong> in the card sorting test. After the card sorting, we listed all the existing categories and their child pages and decreased the number of the categories from 27 to 13. We split the final 13 categories into three parts: main navigation, top navigation, and footer.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="img/MT/mt-cardsort_before.png" alt="The initial labels on the site." class="img-responsive">
                <p>Before the cardsort: 27 categories</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="img/MT/mt-cartsort_after.png" alt="The newly sorted labels." class="img-responsive">
                <p>After the cardsort: 13 categories</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Lowfi Mockup</h4>
        <p>After card sorting, we examined and reorganized the whole website. We assigned each page to its new category. This is the homepage of our low fidelity mockup.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">
                 <div class="col-md-12" style="margin-top: 30px">
                    <img src="img/MT/mt-homepage_lowfi.png" alt="The lowfi mockup created with Balsamiq." class="img-responsive">
                </div>
                <p>Low-fi mockup homepage</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;">  
        <h2><strong>Usability Testing</strong></h2>
        <h4>User Scenarios</h4>
        <p>To understand whether the our Lo-Fi mockup achieved the best user experience, we recruited <strong>5 users</strong> to do our usability test.  According to the instructions from the Nielsen Norman Group, we created a list of <strong>three user scenarios</strong>. In order to meet the needs of the website, the users needed to pretend to be three kinds of roles. They assumed the role of music therapists, patients and family, and other individuals.</p>
        <p>An example user scenario:</p>
        <p><b>The patients and family members of patients, both current and potential</b></p>

        <ul><li>Current patients who want to know more information about music therapy</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You are a patient who wants to try music therapy, but you don’t know much about it. Go to AMTA website and find information providing an explanation of music therapy.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Looking for a therapist</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You are a patient who wants to find a music therapist. Go to AMTA website and search for a music therapist that suits you.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In general, the test results showed that the users could finish the tasks without much burden. However, during the test some of the users wondered whether or not they needed to login to the system to complete different tasks. Some also related the word "Support" to "Tech Support" and not "Donate" as we intended.</p>
        <h4>Site Modifications</h4>
        <p>Based on the usability testing, we created our final modification of AMTA's information architecture.</p>
        
        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;" align="middle">
                <div class="col-md-6">

                    <p>Initial ATMA site modification</p>

                </div>
        </div>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>After recreating the new sitemap, we designed our high-fidelity prototype.</p>

        <h2><strong>Moving Forward</strong></h2>
            <h4>Learning Points</h4>
            <p>Through redesigning the American Music Therapy Association website, my group and I corrected the website's organization, conducted usability testing, and designed a prototype.</p>
            <p>We learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The whole user experience research process for redesigning a website.</li>
